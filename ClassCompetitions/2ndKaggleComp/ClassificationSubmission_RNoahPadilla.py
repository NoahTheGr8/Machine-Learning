Evaluation: 
    The evaluation metric for this competition is Mean F1-Score. The F1 score, 
    commonly used in information retrieval, measures accuracy using the statistics 
    precision p and recall r. Precision is the ratio of true positives (tp) to all 
    predicted positives (tp + fp). Recall is the ratio of true positives to all 
    actual positives (tp + fn). The F1 score is given by:
    
            > F1=2pâ‹…rp+r  where  p=tptp+fp,  r=tptp+fn
    
    
    The F1 metric weights recall and precision equally, and a good retrieval algorithm 
    will maximize both precision and recall simultaneously. Thus, moderately good 
    performance on both will be favored over extremely good performance on one and poor 
    performance on the other.

Submission Format:
    Submissions to the Kaggle leaderboard must take a specific form. 
    Submissions should be a csv with two columns, "ID" and "Prediction" and 
    55822 rows corresponding to the test observations. Including the header row,
    there will be 55823 rows in the submission file. The "ID" is a unique numeric 
    identifier from "1", "2", ... to "55822". The "Prediction" is your predicted 
    flux for the test set.
    
Data Description:
    Each row of x_train (and x_test) represents flares for 1 hour and y_train 
    represents if there is any flare in next 30 minutes.
    x-val and corresponding y_val is also provided to check the performance of the model.
